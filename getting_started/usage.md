# How to use piladb?

Now that you know [how to install **piladb**](installation.md) and what do you need to start using it, let's do real things with it. We will start a `pilad` server and play with it. You don't need to understand all of the steps, copy-pasting the steps in your terminal and checking the output will be enough for now.

## Start the server

If you followed correctly the [Installation](installation.md) instructions as an admin, you should have access to the `pilad` binary:

```
pilad -h
```

Do you see the Usage of `pilad` as an output? Then you are fine. `pilad` provides some configuration flags, but we'll stick with the defauls for now. Let's start the server for real:

```
pilad
```

This will show you the logs in your terminal. Something like this:

Keep an eye on this output, as it will log all activities processed by `pilad`.

> üîù **_Protip!_** You can log into a file with `pilad &> pilad.log &`

## Play with piladb

> We will use `curl` for this walkthrough. You can use your favorite HTTP client, considering that some options might change.

So now `pilad` is running on `localhost:1205`. If we access the root page will be redirected to the official `pilad` REST API documentation:

```bash
curl -L localhost:1205
# -L follow redirects
```

We can also check the current status of **piladb**:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/_status
```

Or the current configuration values:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/_config
```

### Create a Database

To start working with **piladb**, we need to create a new _Database_, which  will contain the _Stacks_ we will work with:

```bash
curl -XPUT localhost:1205/databases?name=MY_DATABASE
```

We will see the new _Database_ as an output in JSON format. We can have access to this content everytime by requesting the new _Database_ itself:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE
```

```json
{
  "number_of_stacks": 0,
  "name": "MY_DATABASE",
  "id": "da5bf1684cdb20bd0be0b767007b9e82"
}
```

> üîù **_Protip!_** Install [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to pretty print and process the JSON responses.

Also, we can list all existing databases:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/databases
```

```json
{
  "databases": [
    {
      "number_of_stacks": 0,
      "name": "MY_DATABASE",
      "id": "da5bf1684cdb20bd0be0b767007b9e82"
    }
  ],
  "number_of_databases": 1
}
```

### Create a Stack

We created a _Database_, this means we can start creating _Stacks_. The process is very similar to the one of creating _Databases_. We just need to provide the _Database_ and the name of the _Stack_.

For this example, we'll create a _Stack_ called `BOOKSHELF` that will contain books:

```bash
curl -XPUT localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks?name=BOOKSHELF
```

```json
{
  "size": 0,
  "peek": null,
  "name": "BOOKSHELF",
  "id": "682fdfca692a0ad5d46ac6ea35fc4f28"
}
```

As an output we get the _Stack_ in JSON format. The bookshelf if empty and there's no book on top that we can pick-up.

### `PUSH`, `PEEK`, `POP` and `SIZE` on a Stack

Let's add a book into the bookshelf by doing a `PUSH` operation.

```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF \
  -d '{"element":{"title":"1984","author":"George Orwell","ISBN":"1595404325","comments":[]}}'
```

This will return the status of the _Stack_:

```json
{
  "size": 1,
  "peek": {
    "title": "1984",
    "comments": [],
    "author": "George Orwell",
    "ISBN": "1595404325"
  },
  "name": "BOOKSHELF",
  "id": "682fdfca692a0ad5d46ac6ea35fc4f28"
}
``` 

We can get this status anytime by requesting our _Stack_:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF
```

We want to read _1984_, but in the meantime we come up with another book that we'd like to read before. So we add it with another `PUSH` operation:

```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF \     
  -d '{"element":{"title":"The Metamorphosis","author":"Franz Kafka","ISBN":"9780486290300","comments":["üêû"]}}'
```

Now we have two books, and we have to start reading them from top to bottom. To find out which _Element_ is on top, we use the `PEEK` operation:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF?peek
```

```json
{
  "element": {
    "title": "The Metamorphosis",
    "comments": [
      "üêû"
    ],
    "author": "Franz Kafka",
    "ISBN": "9780486290300"
  }
}
```

Seems like we start reading _The Metamorphosis_ in order to empty our bookshelf. To consume an _Element_ from a _Stack_, we use the `POP` operation:

```bash
curl -XDELETE localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF
```

We get _The Metaphorphosis_ as a response, but if we fetch the status of the _Stack_ we'll only find _1984_ as a pending book in the bookshelf:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF
```

```json
{
  "size": 1,
  "peek": {
    "title": "1984",
    "comments": [],
    "author": "George Orwell",
    "ISBN": "1595404325"
  },
  "name": "BOOKSHELF",
  "id": "682fdfca692a0ad5d46ac6ea35fc4f28"
}
``` 

We finally read the pending book by doing a `POP` operation on the _Stack_:

```bash
curl -XDELETE localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF
```

And we make sure the bookshelf is empty by running a `SIZE` operation on the _Stack_:

```bash
curl localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF?size
```

The result is `0`, so we read all pending books!

### Cleanup

* `FLUSH` a _Stack_ so all _Elements_ are deleted on it:

  ```bash
  curl -XDELETE localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF?flush
  ```
* Delete a _Stack_:

  ```bash
  curl -XDELETE localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE/stacks/BOOKSHELF?full
  ```
* Delete a _Database_:

  ```bash
  curl -XDELETE localhost:1205/databases/MY_DATABASE
  ```

## Recap

In this page we have started a `pilad` server, we learnt how to create a _Database_ and a _Stack_, and how to handle the latter and _Elements_ by using an idea of a bookshelf where we can pile books, and only read the one on top. Finally, we have applied a cleanup, deleting all existing resources.
