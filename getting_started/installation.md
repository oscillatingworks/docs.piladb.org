# Installation

The process of installing **piladb** might differ depending on your role and purposes.

## For users ðŸ™‹

As a user of **piladb** you only need a HTTP client that lets interact with the REST API database server, `pilad`. This a list of some of the most popular HTTP clients out there:

* Command line interface: [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/), [`httpie`](https://httpie.org/).
* Graphical user interface:
  * [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) (Linux, Mac Windows)
  * [Paw](https://paw.cloud/) (Mac)
  * [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (web, Mac)
* Programming languages: Every language should have a solid HTTP client that lets you interact programatically with **piladb**. A simple web search should point you into the right direction. For example, [HTTP clients for Ruby](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ruby+http+client).

## For admins ðŸ¤“

As an admin, you want to manage `pilad`, the **piladb** server. In order to do that, you can choose one of the following approaches:

### Releases

> Requirements: `zip` or `tar`.

All official **piladb** releases are hosted on Github. Find the latest release for your platform and architecture on [the Downloads list at the release page](https://github.com/fern4lvarez/piladb/releases/latest). They are available on `zip` and `tar.gz` formats.

When you uncompressed the file, you will find a `pilad` binary file. Set execution permissions to the file (`chmod +x pilad`)
