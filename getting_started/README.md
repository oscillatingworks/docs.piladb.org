# Getting Started

## Preface

The main purpose of **piladb** is to be easy to understand, and easier to use. If you are trying to get started and you failed, don't blame yourself, we didn't do our job correctly!

Before installing **piladb**, it's worth to mention that it was designed and developed with **Linux** systems in mind. Although, compatibility and first class support for **macOS** is guaranteed, and it will stay like this forever. Said this, **piladb** should work on **Windows**, yet there's not official support as of now.


## What is piladb?

**piladb** is a database engine, which means that it's a tool that provides mechanisms to store data in a certain way. In the case of **piladb**, this way is by piling data elements in _Stacks_, so you only have access to the element on top, but keeping the rest of them underneath.
