# piladb

Welcome to the official **piladb** documentation!

In these pages you will find all needed instructions to install and use **piladb**,
but also additional information about the internals, configuration management or
how to implement your own embedded database using the Go package.

You can find all chapters in the [Table of Contents](#SUMMARY.md), so you can feel free to jump
through them at your convenience. Although, it is recommended to read the whole
documentation
