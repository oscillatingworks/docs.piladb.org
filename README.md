# piladb documentation

Welcome to the official **piladb** documentation!

In these pages you will find all needed instructions to install and use **piladb**. Furthermore, there is additional information about functionality, the internals, configuration management or how to implement your own embedded database using the Go package.

You can find all chapters in the Table Of Contents, so you can feel free to jump through them at your convenience. Although, it is recommended to read the whole documentation to get a wider understanding on how **piladb** works.

Please report any issue you might find into the repository's [Issues page](https://github.com/oscillatingworks/docs.piladb.org/issues). Contributions are welcome too.
