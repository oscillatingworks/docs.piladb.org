# Preface

The main purpose of **piladb** is to be easy to understand, and easier to use. If you are trying to get started and you failed, don't blame yourself, we didn't do our job correctly!

Before installing **piladb**, it's worth to mention that it was designed and developed with **Linux** systems in mind. Although, compatibility and first class support for **macOS** is guaranteed, and it will stay like this forever. Said this, **piladb** should work on **Windows** too, yet there's not official support as of now.
